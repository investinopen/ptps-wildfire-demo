This code was written to explore various relevant datasets in different formats, experimenting with how to bring them together in a cohesive way.

Requires [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

For Python dependencies managed with `uv`, use a regular CPython build (for example `3.14.6`), not a free-threaded build (for example `3.14.6t` / `3.14.6+freethreaded`). Some binary packages used by this project (such as `lonboard` -> `geoarrow-rust-core`) do not currently publish free-threaded wheels.
